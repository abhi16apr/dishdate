🍽️ Concept Overview

DishDate is a dating app that connects people through their shared love of food. Instead of swiping endlessly, users can match based on restaurant specials and cuisines they’re interested in visiting that day. The app shows “Today’s Specials” from nearby restaurants and lets users coordinate a date or discover matches with compatible dining preferences.

🧩 Core MVP Goals

Connect users around food experiences rather than personality traits alone.

Simplify planning by recommending real restaurants with daily specials.

Enable quick matching based on overlapping restaurant/cuisine interests.

        if user != other_user:
            if shared_restaurant_interest(user, other_user) and shared_time(user, other_user):
